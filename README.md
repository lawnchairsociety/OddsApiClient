# OddsApiClient

A client for interacting with the Odds API sports betting API.

## Preamble

This project is labor of love and whatever free time I have to work on it. If you encounter issues or would like to see new features, feel free to open an issue here: [https://github.com/lawnchairsociety/OddsApiClient/issues](https://github.com/lawnchairsociety/OddsApiClient/issues).

There is one library project, one example console project, and a unit test project in this repo:

- OddsApiClient
- OddsApiClient.ExampleConsole
- OddsApiClient.ExampleApi
- OddsApiClient.EndToEndTests
